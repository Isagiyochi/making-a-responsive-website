            <p class="paraa">Description:<br>
                The story picks up six months after the events of the original series. The main characters, including Ikoma, Mumei, and Ayame, are part of the Kotetsujyo, a fortified train that serves as both their home and primary mode of transportation. They are traveling towards Unato, a city that has been under siege by the Kabane for some time. Their goal is to assist in the recapture of Unato from the Kabane and to discover the source of a mysterious signal that suggests there might be survivors in the city.

                Part 2: The Battle for Unato
                Upon arriving at Unato, the Kotetsujyo crew joins forces with the local resistance led by the city's governor, Kageyuki. They learn that the Kabane in Unato are unusually coordinated and seem to be following a leader known as the "Unato Kabaneri." This new threat is a hybrid creature that possesses the intelligence of a human and the strength of a Kabane. As they prepare for the assault, tensions rise within the group, particularly between Ikoma and Mumei, as they struggle with their own fears and doubts.
                
                The battle itself is intense and brutal. The Kotetsujyo crew and the local soldiers engage in fierce combat against the Kabane. Ikoma, using his expertise as a Kabaneri (a human-Kabane hybrid), leads the charge and devises strategies to counter the Kabane's attacks. Mumei, despite her insecurities, proves to be a formidable fighter and plays a crucial role in the battle.</p>
